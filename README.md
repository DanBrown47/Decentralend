### SLO Hacks 2020 Best Fintech/Blockchain Hack Winner

A zero-interest, zero-collateral, decentralized lending platform built on the Ethereum network that allows users across the globe to lend real currency to each other on a decentralized, trust-backed system. Building off the concept of savings circles that have become popular in areas without access to banks, we created a platform to facilitate peer to peer lending within groups of trusted participants. (Note to fully use the application Metamask plugin must be installed to communicate with Ethereum network)
